                Arch Linux is a lightweight, rolling-release distribution aimed
                at experienced users who want a highly customizable system. It
                follows the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) philosophy, providing

                you need.

                stack, and configuration. This makes Arch ideal for users who
                enjoy learning how Linux works under the hood.
